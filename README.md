# COVID-19
This project was completed as part of an assignment for my CS51 Spring Class. It includes a model that predicts the spread of coronavirus in San Francisco. It also includes Christofides' algorithm that produces the shortest path to take for the potential delivery of vaccines for the COVID-19 across US cities.
